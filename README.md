# What?
This is a simple and not very careful script that fetches ACM-ICPC WF scoreboards and puts them on a table formatted for [vjudge's](https://vjudge.net/) replay contest feature. 

# Instructions
- Visit [some WF scoreboard](http://myicpc.icpcnews.com/World-Finals-2016/scoreboard) on myicpc live.
- Run the script on `fetch.js` using developer tools
- Copy that table to some [spreadsheet software](docs.google.com/spreadsheets)
- Create a contest on [vjudge](https://vjudge.net) and select "Replay" on type
- Upload the spreadsheet on "Replay Info"

# Working Sample
I've had some trouble when submitting the final xlsl to vjudge. I've added a sample xlsl for you to maybe have less trouble with that than I did. It's the `workingsample.xlsl` file. Good luck.
